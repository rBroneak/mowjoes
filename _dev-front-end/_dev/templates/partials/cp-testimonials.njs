				<h2>Just started with Joe. Initially he stopped by to survey our lot. Started following week and did great job. We plan to use Joes service for remainder of season. Invoice was clear and prompt.</h2>

				<h2>Very quick to remove the snow from our drive! Joe was very easy to talk to when I had questions while I was looking for a snow service. So far he has been excellent at clearing the driveway.</h2>

				<h2>Joe did a great job on my spring yard cleanup at a very reasonable price. I was putting my house on the market so I had a tight timeline. He got me on the schedule immediately, worked quickly and the yard looks better than it has in years! I'm hiring him to do my yard maintenance this summer and know I made the right decision.</h2>
